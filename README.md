# OpenCV_Color_Detection - Yellow Objects

This project implements a real-time color detection system using OpenCV and Python, specifically designed to detect yellow objects. It was created as a learning exercise following a tutorial to understand the basics of color detection using computer vision techniques.

## Project Overview

This application demonstrates the use of OpenCV to identify and highlight yellow objects in a video stream from a webcam. It serves as a practical example of applying color space conversion, color thresholding, and contour detection in a real-world scenario.

## Features

- Real-time video processing using OpenCV
- Detection and highlighting of yellow objects
- Conversion from BGR to HSV color space for improved color detection
- Contour detection to outline detected objects
- Display of detection results in a live video feed
